mistra-matlab
=============

MATLAB/Octave functions for atmospheric chemistry modelling and for
analysis of the MISTRA (http://www.uea.ac.uk/~fkd06bju/mistra.html)
boundary layer model output.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

GNU Octave (http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) is an open source
implementation of MATLAB (http://mathworks.com/). The functions in
this package have been developed and tested on Octave version 3.2.4
and should work without problems on MATLAB proper.

For GNU Octave, the following additional packages are required:
 - io (version 1.0.12)
 - octcdf (version 1.0.17)

These packages can be found on the OCTAVE-FORGE website
(http://octave.sourceforge.net/). Follow the download and install
instructions on the OCTAVE-FORGE website.

Note 1: newer versions of the io package may cause problems with some
functions.

Note 2: the octcdf package may require installation of NetCDF
libraries.


INSTALL
-------

Unpack the archive in a directory of your choice (e.g.,
~/mistra_matlab/), then add the directory to the load path of
Octave/MATLAB.

In MATLAB this is done from the Preferences dialog.

In Octave add the following line to the ~/.octaverc file:

    addpath ("~/mistra_matlab/")


DESCRIPTION
-----------

There are three groups of functions in this package:

1) generic functions for common calculations in atmospheric chemistry
modelling: rate coefficients, lifetimes, ideal gas law, conversion of
measurements units, etc...

2) MISTRA specific functions to analyze and plot the output files
generated by the MISTRA model. These functions are named:
 - plotNC_*.m
 - multiplotNC_*.m
 - mistra*.m

 Function plotNC_traj.m is not specifically for MISTRA: it reads and
 plots the netCDF files of back-trajectories generated by the BADC
 Trajectory Service (http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/community/trajectory/). It
 requires the WCL.dat file with world map coordinates in MATLAB format
 (also included in this package).

3) utilities used by the other functions. These are stored in the
m_files/ directory and are partly taken from the freeware JLAB data
analysis package (http://www.jmlilly.net/jmlsoft.html).

All functions are documented. The help text of each function describes
what it does, which input parameters are required and what is the
output. The help text of a function can be recalled from the
Octave/MATLAB command line with the command:

    help  <name of the function>
